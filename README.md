# 📦 Kronner Logística – Prototype

**Kronner Logística** is a prototype website I developed for a **messaging and delivery service**.  
The project was built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on a clean, modern, and responsive design.

The site includes a **fully functional contact form**, powered by a **Node.js + Express** backend, allowing users to send requests and inquiries dynamically.  
Although this is a prototype version, it served as the **foundation for the final site delivered to the client**, with minor content and style adjustments.
